										<h2>Behind the scenes in a news broadcast studio session</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As a journalism student, visiting behind the scenes of a news broadcast studio session was an eye-opening experience. I watched as producers coordinated every segment with precision, anchors prepared for live reports under intense studio lights, and camera operators worked seamlessly to capture each shot. The fast-paced environment highlighted the importance of timing, teamwork, and adaptability. Seeing how scripts, teleprompters, and live feeds came together in real-time deepened my appreciation for the technical and creative effort that goes into delivering the news accurately and professionally.<p>

										<h2>Visit to Uhuru Park</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Visiting Uhuru Park was both inspiring and insightful. Nestled in the heart of Nairobi, the park was alive with activity—families relaxing, street performers entertaining crowds, and vendors offering colorful snacks. I captured moments of everyday life through my lens: children chasing bubbles, elders engaged in animated conversation, and young couples enjoying quiet moments by the fountain. The vibrant atmosphere and diverse interactions made it a perfect spot to observe and document human stories, reminding me of the power of journalism in capturing real, unfiltered slices of life.<p>

										<h2>Going out for a walk</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As a journalism student, going out for a walk turned into an opportunity to observe and capture the subtle stories unfolding around me. With my notebook and camera in hand, I documented everyday moments—a street vendor setting up his stall, a child skipping beside her mother, and an elderly man quietly feeding birds on a park bench. The rhythm of the city came alive through these small, unscripted scenes. Each step offered a new perspective, reminding me that compelling stories often exist in the simplest of moments, waiting to be noticed and told.<p>

										<h2>Invitation to a Corporate Event</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Attending a corporate event offered a unique glimpse into the professional world of business communication and networking. I observed keynote speakers delivering powerful messages, guests engaging in thoughtful conversations, and teams celebrating shared achievements. Moments I captured included the handshake between two CEOs, a panelist passionately addressing the audience, and candid exchanges over coffee during breaks. The polished setting, strategic branding, and formal atmosphere contrasted sharply with the everyday stories I was used to, giving me a broader perspective on how stories are told and perceived in the corporate space.<p>

										<h2>Receiving flowers from a loved one</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As a journalism student, receiving a flower gift from a loved one was a tender moment that reminded me of the human side behind every story. I captured the gentle details—the soft petals wrapped in simple paper, the handwritten note tucked inside, and the warmth in their eyes as they handed it to me. In a world often focused on headlines and breaking news, this quiet gesture spoke volumes about love, connection, and the small, beautiful moments that deserve to be remembered and shared.<p>
